# Estimate painting prices with machine learning

### polynomial maps with various degrees
### neural networks with various numbers of layers and nodes per layer

The purpose of this project is to see how well painting values can be estimated with machine learning.
The dataset was collected from the website artsy.com through html-parsing scripts (see .py-files)

The .pdf-file in this repository contains the detailed report and documentation of this project.
